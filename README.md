- **Don't fully rely on ChatGPT:**
  - Even if the beginning is right, verify details.
- **Scope: Start with a small size:**
  - Try to start with a small amount (e.g., half size) compared to the recipe.
  - If you fail, you won't have to deal with as much waste.
- **Scale and prepare all ingredients before starting to cook:**
  - Why: Once you start cooking, you may get lazy and skip scaling ingredients.
  - Make sure to use a scale or proper measuring cups and teaspoons.
- **Butter:**
  - Doesn't need to be fully melted.
  - It will naturally soften as you mix.
  - Cut into slices or pieces for easier mixing is more important.

  - Never opt out of using borwn sugar.
  - Don't use 100% white sugar; brown sugar is essential!.
  - Total amount of the sugar can be reduced by 20%-30% if desired.
